Welcome to an exciting Snake and Ladders game where up to four players can engage in a thrilling adventure! 
To get started, players enter their names, creating a lively gaming environment. 
To ensure fair play, the system checks for duplicate names, ensuring each player is unique.

Adding an extra layer of excitement, the game features a unique random die. The probability of rolling a six is intentionally reduced, introducing an element of strategy and unpredictability. But here's the twist â€“ if a player happens to roll three consecutive sixes, a game-changing event occurs. All the sixes accumulated are nullified, and the player receives only the value rolled on the latest turn.

A 10x10 game board is illustrated below with designated positions for snakes (S) and ladders (L), while players are represented as P1, P2, P3, and so on. The grid displays numbers as displayed, just like actual snake and ladders.

To initiate the game, input the names of the players and hit enter to roll the random die, inputting the numbers. The random dice roll will determine the player's movements on the board. If a player rolls a 6, they get an additional turn. The program continues until only one player remains, giving the final rankings.

Get ready for the adventure of snake and ladders which creates suspense among the users.
